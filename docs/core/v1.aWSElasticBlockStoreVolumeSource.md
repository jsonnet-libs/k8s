## aWSElasticBlockStoreVolumeSource
Represents a Persistent Disk resource in AWS.

An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

**Functions:**

[`fn .withFsType`](#fn-withfstype)  
[`fn .withPartition`](#fn-withpartition)  
[`fn .withReadOnly`](#fn-withreadonly)  
[`fn .withVolumeID`](#fn-withvolumeid)  

---


### `fn .withFsType`
Filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount. Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system. Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#awselasticblockstore
```jsonnet
{
  withFsType(fsType):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withPartition`
The partition in the volume that you want to mount. If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name. Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as "1". Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty).
```jsonnet
{
  withPartition(partition):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withReadOnly`
Specify "true" to force and set the ReadOnly property in VolumeMounts to "true". If omitted, the default is "false". More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#awselasticblockstore
```jsonnet
{
  withReadOnly(readOnly):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withVolumeID`
Unique ID of the persistent disk resource in AWS (Amazon EBS volume). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#awselasticblockstore
```jsonnet
{
  withVolumeID(volumeID):: {}
}
```

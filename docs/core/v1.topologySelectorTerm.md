## topologySelectorTerm
A topology selector term represents the result of label queries. A null or empty topology selector term matches no objects. The requirements of them are ANDed. It provides a subset of functionality as NodeSelectorTerm. This is an alpha feature and may change in the future.

**Functions:**

[`fn .withMatchLabelExpressions`](#fn-withmatchlabelexpressions)

### `fn .withMatchLabelExpressions`
A list of topology selector requirements by labels.

## nodeSelectorRequirement
A node selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

**Functions:**

[`fn .withKey`](#fn-withkey)  
[`fn .withOperator`](#fn-withoperator)  
[`fn .withValues`](#fn-withvalues)  

---


### `fn .withKey`
The label key that the selector applies to.
```jsonnet
{
  withKey(key):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withOperator`
Represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist. Gt, and Lt.
```jsonnet
{
  withOperator(operator):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withValues`
An array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. If the operator is Gt or Lt, the values array must have a single element, which will be interpreted as an integer. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
```jsonnet
{
  withValues(values):: {}
}
```
